This directory will serve as a personal reference for fundamental structures, algorithms, and concepts. I am mostly using it to familiarize myself with git and make a habit of using git. I will add much more soon, including diffrent variations and different languages of the same algorithms and structures. Each directory will contain it's own readme and update history.
