This directory will serve as a personal reference for fundamental structures, algorithims, and concepts. I am mostly using it to familiarize myself with git and make a habit of using git.
I will add much more soon, including diffrent variations and diffrent languages of the same algorithims and structures.
Each directory will contain it's own readme and update history.
